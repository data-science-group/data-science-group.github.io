Early-stage work includes comparative testing of segmentation architectures—U-Net, DeepLab, attention U-Nets—especially for fine-grained defects like hairline cracks that are easy to miss. You'll iterate rapidly, evaluate performance metrics, and refine model pipelines based on live feedback from annotation teams.",Annotation tool framework (human-in-the-loop),"You'll design and build an annotation workflow integrated with CVAT, enabling expert reviewers to label defect type, severity, geometry, confidence, and review status efficiently. The system will incorporate model and LLM suggestions to accelerate labelling and maintain consistency, with optional scalability via Amazon Mechanical Turk. High-quality annotations feed directly back into training pipelines—creating a tight feedback loop that continuously improves model performance.",,
