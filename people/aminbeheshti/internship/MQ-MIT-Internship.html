Master Program -Internship (COMP8851/COMP8860)</h1>	
	
<h1>For Students:</h1>	
When enroling in COMP8851, you have 2 options: <b>Internship</b> OR <b>Internal Project</b>. This information page is only for the <b>Internship</b>. If you have questions regarding the&nbsp; <b>Internal Project</b> (a mini research project supervised by an academic), please contact Prof. <i>Abhaya Nayak</i> "abhaya.nayak@mq.edu.au".	
	<ul>
		
		<li> For Internship, students MUST fill out the <b>Expression of Interest (EoI) Form</b> here:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://forms.gle/GCcPgUeDMEeNVruV9" target="_blank">Student EoI Form - s1-2025</a></li>

		<li>You need to be in your final semester to qualify for the Internship. Additionally, we strongly suggest having a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of 75 or higher.</li>
		<li>Your Internship project MUST align with your field of study. For instance, if you're pursuing a Master's in Cyber Security, ensure that your Internship project is relevant to the field of Cyber Security.</li>
		<li>If your Program Leader approves your case, you can do an Internal Project in your 3rd semester (2-year program) of your study plan.</li>
	  <li>To be able to enrol for the Internship, there should be a company supporting your Internship. We also highly recommend you also try to find a company yourself.</li>
		<li>You are not allowed to enrol for the Internship unless a company sponsors your Internship. It means that, if you are enroled in COMP8860/COMP885 without following the above-mentioned process, your enrolment will become invalid.</li>
		<li>You will be able to enrol for a part-time or full-time Internship.
			<ul>
				<li>Part-time Internship (20 cp): you should enrol in the COMP8851 unit</li>
				<li>full-time Internship (40 cp): you should enrol in COMP8851+COMP8860  units</li>
				<li><b>Important Notice: </b>
					<ul>
                       <li>You cannot enrol in COMP8860 by itself. This unit can be only combined with COMP8851 (in one semester) to form a Full-time Internship.</li>
					   <li>Who can do a full-time Internship? In particular, if you have COMP8860 available as an option to enrol in, then you should be able to do the full-time Internship.</li>
					   <li>If you are an employee of a company, then you <b>cannot</b> do an Internship in the same company. Such students should do an Internal Project instead.</li>
                       <li>Students should undertake a relevant project/Internship that is consistent with their chosen major/specialization.</li>
					   <li>Internship is a unit, and the start and end date *MUST* be from Week 1 to Week 13 of that semester.</li>
					</ul>
