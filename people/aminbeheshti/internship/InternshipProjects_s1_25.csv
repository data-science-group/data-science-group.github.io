relationships between independent variables such as tactical marketing
strategies, experimental campaigns, social media frequency, seasonality, and
events, with sales as the dependent variable. Additionally, the project will
account for potential distraction effects, such as event-related capacity
limitations, slower table turnover, and changes in customer spending behaviour.

This project focuses on developing a state-of-the-art data portal platform to support researchers in the field of bioinformatics, with an emphasis on genomic and epigenomic datasets. By providing access to this data, along with analytical tools, this platform facilitates the study of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of Meniere Disease. Our goal is to empower researchers by delivering intuitive, data-driven insights through visualisation and advanced reporting.

We are seeking talented students to join our team, particularly to contribute to the backend development of this platform. Your role will include designing optimised queries and creating interactive visualisations for genomic and epigenomic datasets.

About the Project
The Genomic and Epigenomic Data Portal integrates two critical datasets:

Genomic Data

Description: Contains genetic variant information mapped to chromosomal positions.
Use Cases: Helps uncover patterns of genetic mutations and their associations with diseases or traits.

Epigenomic Data

Description: Focuses on DNA methylation, a key epigenetic marker.
Use Cases: Provides insights into gene regulation and its impact on cell function under different conditions.
Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors.

Analytical Features and Visualisations
Inspired by platforms like gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000188162?dataset=gnomad_r4) , this portal will feature dynamic reporting and interactive visualisations:

Genomic Data Report

Visualisation: A chart with the horizontal axis representing Position Numbers (from the CSV file) and the vertical axis representing Variants Count.
Objective: Extract insights into variant distribution across genomic regions through optimised queries.
Epigenomic (Methylation) Data Report

Visualisation: A similar chart tailored to represent methylation levels across positions.
Objective: Analyse methylation patterns across genomic regions, aiding in epigenetic studies.","Transcriptomic Data Portal","Project Description
This project is dedicated to building a specialised platform for transcriptomic data, supporting researchers in exploring RNA-based datasets. By providing tools for analysing gene expression levels, the platform enables breakthroughs in understanding how genes are regulated in various biological contexts. Our objective is to deliver intuitive visualisations and comprehensive reporting, similar in functionality to gnomAD.

We are seeking talented students to contribute to the backend development of this project, with a focus on optimising queries and designing visual dashboards for transcriptomic data.

About the Project
The Transcriptomic Data Portal focuses on one essential dataset:

Transcriptomic Data
Description: Captures RNA sequencing information, enabling the study of gene expression levels and biological pathways.
Use Cases: Provides insights into which genes are activated or suppressed in specific cell types or experimental conditions.
This dataset forms the foundation for studying how gene activity changes in health and disease.

Analytical Features and Visualisations
Drawing inspiration from platforms like gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000188162?dataset=gnomad_r4), the portal will offer advanced reporting and dynamic visualisation capabilities:

Transcriptomic Data Report
Visualisation: A chart with the horizontal axis representing Cell Types (from the CSV file) and the vertical axis representing Genes (Log2).
Objective: Enable researchers to study gene expression trends across various cell types, providing actionable insights.","",""

During co-design workshops, several ideas were identified to help with language barriers and health system literacy. One idea involves developing a system, an application that would help manage the expectations of the people in the waiting room. Not knowing how long one might have to wait is a source of anxiety, and being able to understand where one stands in the queue could alleviate this anxiety as well as reassure the patients and carers that they have not been forgotten. The app would communicate estimated waiting time and busyness level of the ED to patients and carers in the waiting room. The system has a data extraction and processing component, as well as a visual component to display the data in an intuitive way on a screen in the ED waiting room. The intuitive part is crucial as it needs to be suitable for people with CALD backgrounds. A storyboard, while still needing to be refined, describes how the application would work from the userâ€™s point of view- available as a picture that this form cannot accomodate.
 
We are seeking two students interested in developing such an application that would be first piloted then implemented in a Western Sydney Hospital ED waiting room. The working hours are flexible. The students would need to come to the AIHI office as needed. The MyED team is part of the Human Factors and Resilience stream at the Australian Institute of Health Innovation in the Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Sciences.
